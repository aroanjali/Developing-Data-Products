## Predicting Demand for a given price

This shiny application predicts demand for a given price. User can input the price in the input textbox and press **Submit**. Then the algorithm predicts demand (in units) at the input price. 
Demand has an inverse relationship with price - so as the price goes up, demand goes down. For price > 200, the product becomes undesirable and demand stays at 0. Price <= 0 is invalid entry, and demand displayed is NA.
User inputs a price ($100-$200), and the application displays the demand predicted by the alglorithm, along with the price entered by user. 

This was a basic application designed using Slidify to show various features of a Shiny App. It can be enhanced to add more graphs and advanced visualization features such as dynamic filters etc.
